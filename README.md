# ROS2 basics

This is a workspace showing how to use the ROS2 basics in isolated, functioning workspaces.  
Next to that README's explain how to set up the package to make it compile, let it run, and troubleshooting tips.  

The workspaces are based on the examples provided by ROS2 itself (https://github.com/ros2/examples/tree/master).  
The point of this repository is to have the examples in actual workspaces to copy the structure you would find
in a real-life example.
